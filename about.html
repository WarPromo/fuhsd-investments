      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to empower students across all FUHSD schools with financial literacy skills and investment knowledge through standardized curricula. Our organization's accomplishment includes students fundraising over $6000 for charitable organizations. They use the investment skills they learn in our clubs to support various causes, showing how their knowledge is put into action for real-world impact.</p>

      <p>Throughout the FUHSD district, we successfully hosted public events and volunteer opportunities. These initiatives drew participation from over 150 students from the district, who learned from a year's worth of curriculum.</p>

      <p>This year, our focus was to establish clubs across all FUHSD campuses. In 2022, we started the first club at Fremont. Our team has already selected club presidents for Homestead and Monta Vista for the second semester of this academic year. Our intention is to implement the curriculum across all schools for these clubs.</p>
